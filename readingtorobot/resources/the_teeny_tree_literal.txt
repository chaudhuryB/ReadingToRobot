it was plant a tree day at school
mr mister beam was teaching the children about seeds
see this teeny little seed here
it contains a teeny little tree
you can have one each
plant them deep
keep them wet and then
and then what mr mister beam
said pip
just wait and see
pip and molly planted the seeds in a pea green pot
do you really think we can grow a tree
maybe
but for one very long week
the pots just sat there
there was no tree to be seen
[groan] this is silly
[happy]keep them wet and wait
then one happy day
in the second week
pip saw a teeny green stem peeping out of the pot
and molly saw a soft green leaf
[excited] you have a tree
said mr mister beam
yippee
said pip and molly
but the next day
the teeny green stem and the soft green leaf had vanished
[sad] molly was very sad
oh dear she said
and a little tear fell down her cheek
hmm said mr mister beam
it looks like snails to me
a soft green leaf is a yummy treat for snails
they have teeny little teeth that go munch much munch
and if we look
[scared] eek molly was screaming
mr mister beam look
three fat snails were sneaking along mr mister beams feet
no need to scream
said mr mister beam
we will let these greedy snails go free
there is plenty to eat in the street
but can someone please tell me
how did they get in
