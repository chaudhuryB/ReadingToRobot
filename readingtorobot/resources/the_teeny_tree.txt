it was plant a tree day at school
it is plant a tree day at school
mister beam was teaching the children about seeds
Mr beam was teaching the children about seeds
see this teeny little seed here
see this little seed here
see this teeny seed here
it contains a teeny little tree
it contains a tiny little tree
you can have one each
plant them deep
keep them wet
keep them wet and then
and then what?
and then what, mr beam?
said pip
just wait and see
pip and molly planted the seeds in a pea-green pot
pip and molly planted the seeds in a green pot
do you really think we can grow a tree?
maybe
But for one very long week, the pots just sat there
there was no tree to be seen
this is silly
keep them wet and wait
then one happy day
in the second week
pip saw a teeny gren stem peeping out of the pot
pip saw a teeny green stem
peeping out of the pot
and molly saw a soft green leaf
molly saw a soft green leaf
you have a tree!
said mr beam
yippee!
said pip and molly
but the next day, the teeny green stem and the soft green leaf had vanished
but the next day, the teeny green stem had vanished
but the next day, the soft green leaf had vanished
the teeny green stem and the soft green leaf had vanished
Molly was very sad
oh dear
she said
a little tear fell down her cheek
hmm, said mr beam
it looks like snails to me
a soft green leaf is a yummy treat for snails
they have teeny little teeth that go munch munch munch
and if we look...
eek!
Molly was screaming!
Mr Beam!
Look!
three fat snails were sneaking along mr beam's feet
no need to scream
said mr beam
we will let these greedy snails go free
there is plenty to eat in the street
but can someone please tell me,
how did they get in?
